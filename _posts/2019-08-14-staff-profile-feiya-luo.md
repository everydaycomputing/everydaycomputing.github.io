### Name ###

Feiya Luo

### LTEC Role ###

Doctoral Research Assistant @ the University of Florida.

### Professional Background ###

I am currently a 4th-year doctoral candidate in Educational Technology at the University of Florida. I received my master’s degree in Translation and Interpretation from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California. I also completed a certificate program in computer programming at Mission College, Santa Clara. A teacher (with many years of experience in K-12 and undergraduate classrooms both in the U.S. and China), translator and interpreter, and website developer, I have gained from various roles experience that has empowered me to pursue my interests in educational technology. Prior to joining LTEC, I built an educational technology that aimed to support children’s interests in botany as well as to provide college students with a hub for information and learning activities in botany. I also ran a research study that involved elementary students in computational thinking-integrated botany using robotics. My current research interests are computational thinking assessment and understanding students’ CT/CS learning progression K-8.

### Why is LTEC my jam? ###

LTEC gives me a great opportunity to work with wonderful researchers, practitioners, and educators around the country on important projects that are moving the field of CS education forward.

### My work ###

Since coming on board, I have been involved in designing and developing elementary CS curriculum and CT assessment, piloting CT lessons at an elementary school, and providing professional development support to CS teachers, etc. I have also come to love writing blog posts on K-8 CS as a way to connect research to practice.

### What I do with my spare time ###

I love trying out new Boba tea shops and restaurants with my PhD crew. I am also “addicted” to one and only one kind of board game, the “Werewolves” (similar to but more complex than “Avalon”). A Florida resident, I try to take advantage of the beautiful waters and shorelines. I am a huge fan of standup paddleboarding and kayaking. My favorite vacation destination is St. Pete Beach, FL.

### Fun facts ###

* My PhD crew knows that I love traveling. During the past three years, I have twice visited D.C., Toronto, Key West, Taiwan, and Puerto Rico, and have also set foot in Savannah, Charleston, Seoul (South Korea), and Nassau (the Bahamas)
