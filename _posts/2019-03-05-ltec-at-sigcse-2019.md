![SIGCSE 2019 - 50th Celebration!]({{ site.images }}/blog/2019-03-05/sigcse-2019-50-years.jpg)

This past weekend, our team presented at the Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) annual conference for 2019. We were treated to a true Minneapolis winter experience, replete with snow, freezing temperatures, and more snow. Fortunately, our motto is: “when life hands you atmospheric water vapor frozen into ice crystals...stay inside, make hot chocolate, and talk about computational thinking.“

Our project was pleased to [debut our latest learning trajectory paper on Debugging](https://whova.com/embedded/session/sigcs_201902/488360/), [contribute a poster on Building Trust in CS Research-Practice Partnerships](https://whova.com/embedded/session/sigcs_201902/501836/), [participate in a panel on accessibility in K-12 CS Education](https://whova.com/embedded/session/sigcs_201902/488467/), and [speak on equity in implementation of CS in K-8 Classrooms](https://whova.com/embedded/subsession/sigcs_201902/488447/488449/). Plus, as a prelude to all of this, LTEC Co-PI Diana Franklin participated in the [RESPECT 2019](http://respect2019.stcbp.org/) (co-located with SIGCSE 2019) keynote panel, [sharing her perspective on providing foundational research to bring CS/CT to a broader audience](https://whova.com/embedded/session/respe_201902/499024/).

<em>Description of session:</em> Curriculum development is dependent on the following question: What are the learning goals for a specific topic, and what are reasonable ways to organize and order those goals? Learning trajectories (LTs) for computational thinking (CT) topics will help to guide emerging curriculum development efforts for computer science in elementary school. This study describes the development of an LT for Debugging. We conducted a rigorous analysis of scholarly research on K-8 computer science education to extract what concepts in debugging students should and are capable of learning. The concepts were organized into the LT presented within. In this paper, we describe the three dimensions of debugging that emerged during the creation of the trajectory: (1) strategies for finding and fixing errors, (2) types of errors, and (3) the role of errors in problem solving. In doing so, we go beyond identification of specific debugging strategies to further articulate knowledge that would help students understand when to use those techniques and why they are successful. Finally, we illustrate how the Debugging LT has guided our efforts to develop an integrated mathematics and CT curriculum for grades 3-5.

<em>Description of session:</em> Creating equitable, sustainable, and productive partnerships between computer science (CS) education researchers and practitioners is essential if we are to further improve CS educational outcomes, practice, and equity. Research-practice partnerships (RPPs) provide one promising approach for expanding how practice may inform research and research may inform practice. This early work, centered around a framework proposed by Henrick et al., and utilizing interview data from 11 participants, explores the ways in which six diverse RPP teams went about developing trusting and collaborative relationships as they worked together to solve local problems of practice. Barriers and challenges to collaboration and trust building, as well as mechanisms by which teams overcame those challenges, are discussed. The study revealed discrete team behaviors, norms, and structures that may contribute to building more collaborative, trusting, and sustainable RPP relationships. Limitations are presented and implications for current and future RPP teams, as well as possible future research directions, are addressed.

<em>Description of session:</em> Computer science (CS) education is rapidly expanding in the United States. That said, the CS education field is still grappling with coming to consensus about definitions of K-12 CS and how to reach all students. While the CS education community has made great efforts to expand opportunity for under served groups, students with disabilities have regularly been left out of the conversation. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 13% of all students enrolled in public schools in the US receive special education services and 95% of these students are taught either part or full time in the regular classroom[3] . One aim of CSforALL is to increase equity in CS education and opportunities[5]. Recent studies have examined the challenges faced by students with disabilities in K12 CS education[1][2]. Including students with disabilities in CS classes not only increases their access to academic and career opportunities in CS, but it also gives them the opportunity to develop new ways of thinking and participating in the world that they would otherwise be potentially without. This panel addresses the inclusion of students with disabilities as part of the national all and seeks to augment the discussion initiated by the CSforALL Consortium and AccessCSforALL with the introduction of the Accessibility Pledge at the annual CSforALL Summit. This panel brings together four different experts, with a wide range of experience in regards to computer science education and students with disabilities, in an effort to expand both the national conversation and increase efforts related to including students with disabilities equitably in CS education.
</p>

<p>
In this panel we present a group of CS education community members who represent multiple approaches to accessibility and serving students with disabilities, as well as diverse implementations; peer-to-peer mentoring, initiatives focused on a single subpopulation of students with disabilities, curriculum and platform providers, and district and state-wide solutions. The panelists, and the organizations they represent have a diversity of experiences to share, including current high school students and parents of students with disabilities.

<em>Description of session:</em> Major metropolitan school districts around the United States are implementing computer science in elementary school classrooms as part of the CS for All (CS4All) initiative. Little is known, however, about the success of such a large-scale rollout, especially in terms of equity. In this study we analyze the performance of 4th grade classrooms completing three modules of an introductory computational thinking curriculum, looking at not only overall results but also the variance in performance between high-, mid-, and low-performing schools (as identified by their school report cards). We find that all classrooms are benefiting from the computational thinking (CT) curriculum, making great strides in providing equitable access to CT education. However, statistically-significant differences in performance are present, especially between the high- and low-performing schools, showing that there is still room for improvement in developing strategies and curricula for struggling learners.

## Twitter moments

### Before SIGCSE 2019:

Katie Rich blogged about our new [Debugging LT and associated paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3287396) which was published in the SIGCSE 2019 proceedings. Make sure to check out her post: [New paper: Debugging LT](https://katiethecurious.com/2019/02/24/new-paper-debugging-lt/).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please check out the new paper from <a href="https://twitter.com/everydaycs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@everydaycs</a> in this year&#39;s SIGCSE proceedings! <a href="https://t.co/F6IrR0nadM">https://t.co/F6IrR0nadM</a></p>&mdash; Katie Rich (@KatietheCurious) <a href="https://twitter.com/KatietheCurious/status/1099471778349531136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2019</a></blockquote>
