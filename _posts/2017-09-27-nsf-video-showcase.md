Earlier this summer the LTEC project participated in the
<a href="http://stemforall2017.videohall.com" target="_blank">2017 NSF STEM for All Video Showcase</a>. The showcase provides the opportunity for Federally funded projects to share their work in STEM and CS education.  In addition to displaying the videos, the initiative invites the community to [engage with the presenters on each videos page through discussion](http://stemforall2017.videohall.com/presentations/961){:target="_blank"}.

Please take a minute to catch up on what's been going on with LTEC, <a href="http://videohall.com/p/961" target="_blank">here</a>
